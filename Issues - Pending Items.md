# Issues - Pending Items

## Pending

1. **Cross-dimensional drill-down levels are not auto-proposed.** `proposeJoinLevels` strictly refines via aggregation edges present on **both** sides. When two key dimensions are independent (e.g., FPSL/EDW: `product_type` and `gl_account` are independent — no hierarchy connects them), only level 0 is proposed; the LLM/operator decides whether to add a second-dimension drill-down via `--key colA=colB:1`. Acceptable design: hierarchy is a strong fact, cross-dimension drill-down is a judgment call. Revisit if users find it confusing.
2. **Drift acknowledgment is not persisted.** SOFT drifts warn and are recorded on the Fingerprint row but there is no repo-A-style ApprovedDrift TTL workflow; HARD drifts always abort.
3. **Parquet/JSON ingestion not implemented** (v1 scope decision). Add readers under `src/ingest/` if real datasets require them.
4. **`node:sqlite` is experimental in Node 22** (warning on stderr). Functionally verified. Resolves when moving to Node ≥ 24.
5. **Slash/dot dates are interpreted day-first** (`dd/mm/yyyy`, documented European convention). US-format files where all days ≤ 12 would be silently misread — fix with an explicit spec override per column if needed.

## Completed

- (2026-06-16) v0.2.0 repositioning: removed all built-in business rules (8 kinds, `BusinessRule` and `RuleRunImpact` tables, `rule add/list/suspend` command, `RuleParamsError` / `FxRateMissingError`), removed built-in markdown report renderer (`src/report.ts`, `report` command, `--report-out` / `--drill-top` config); added column-hierarchy detection (`src/hierarchy.ts`, `ColumnHierarchy` table) running during ingest with `aggregation` / `descriptive` classification and aggregation-chain extraction; `suggest` enriched with hierarchy-driven `proposedLevels` (refinement must be backed by aggregation edges on both sides); new `hierarchy --file-id <id>` lookup command. Real bank data validated: FPSL detects `product group → product type` aggregation + descriptive 1:1 attributes; EDW detects `system → product`; 471 findings reconciled into queryable SQLite. 34/34 tests green, `tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm audit` 0 advisories.
- (2026-06-12) Real-data hardening against the acc-recon FPSL/EDW xlsx extracts: added `xlsx` parse-spec type and xlsx decimal normalization (float artifacts rounded at the 6th decimal, scientific notation `7.0E-2` expanded exactly).
- (2026-06-12) tabrecon v0.1.0 built and verified end-to-end against synthetic and real data.
